# Game-Dev-Portfolio
This repository holds much of my work from 2016 to 2023
Please note that I was 14 in 2016 so do not judge too harshly :)
However, I have come a long way since then and I hope that someone likes what they see.

Hi, I'm Dolphin (Christiaan). I'm from South Africa and I'm a 21 year old male.

I have been a solo hobbiest game developer since I entered high school in 2016.
I have almost solely developed using Unity C# however I am confident in my ability to swap
between software and programming languages. I have limited experience with Python outside of game dev
and I started my programming journey with the 2D visual scripting software "Scratch" back in 2015.
Although I have never worked with other, I am familiar enough with Git and ready to learn and mingle.

Outside of programming I have dabbled in music production, video editing, and photo editing.
In FL Studio, Sony Vegas Pro, and Photoshop respectively. I am a bit of a designer at heart.
I know a thing or two about designing stuff for humans.

Outside of the creative sphere, I have had a job in the management of a small ecommerce business
in my local town. I have *limited* experience with a wide range of businessy stuff like project management,
legal work, administrative tasks and organization, conducting meetings, marketing, web development,
sales, and being a team player of course.

I am currently a co-founder of a soon to be ecommerce platform here in South Africa
as part of a 3 man team. However, many more people are involved outside of the "Team".
I have a wide network that I can tap into because I happen to be a nice guy, and I didn't know
that meant people would want to assist me when I am down. I have a lot of time on my hands currently
as we are developing our system and my team has agreed to let me find a game development 
job (if i can find one). Otherwise any other job (which is really tough to come by in South Africa).

In high school my subjects of choice were: Physical Sciences (Chemistry and Physics), Mathematics Core,
Life Sciences (Biology/Ecology/Anatomy), and Computer Applications Technology.
I did really badly at school due to unfortunate life events which do not hold me back any longer.

As much as I love to be creative and play around with my thoughts and ideas, they are not much use
without action (although still fun to think about). I crave results and accomplishment and will
stop at nothing to make something I care about happen.

Thank you for your time.

Much love and warm regards,
Christiaan Visser
